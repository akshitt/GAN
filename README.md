# Generative Adversarial Networks
Here are the pytorch implementations of some popular GAN architectures. They have been trained on those respective datasets - 
* [DCGAN on CelebA dataset](https://github.com/akshitt/GAN/blob/main/DCGAN_CelebA_dataset.ipynb)
* [VanillaGAN on MNIST dataset](https://github.com/akshitt/GAN/blob/main/Vanilla_GAN.ipynb)
* [DCGAN on MNIST dataset](https://github.com/akshitt/GAN/blob/main/DCGAN_MNIST_dataset.ipynb)
